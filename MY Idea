Hello , I want to teach the youth as education is very important tool for everyone to succeed in life and get something different. It helps a lot in lessening the challenges of life difficult life.

I want to build a community of different programmers like one who know about "Java" and other who knows "Kotlin" and other who knows "C++" and
so on when we havae programmers for different languages we will start creating course of these languages and put it on different platforms like
Udemy , Udacity etc and make it free for a specific period of time and let as many students as can enroll themselves and learn through our
community.
